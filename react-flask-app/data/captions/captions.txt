He came home a hero, but the war never left him.

A life of excess, shrouded in mystery.

A love story, a dangerous game, and a past he can't escape.

He wants her back, but can he rewrite their story?

The truth is a dangerous weapon, and someone will pay the price.

This summer, love burns brighter than the truth.
