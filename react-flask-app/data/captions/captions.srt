1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
He came home a hero, but the war never left him.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
A life of excess, shrouded in mystery.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A love story, a dangerous game, and a past he can't escape.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
He wants her back, but can he rewrite their story?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The truth is a dangerous weapon, and someone will pay the price.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This summer, love burns brighter than the truth.
