A young boy is flying in a small plane over a vast wilderness. He is on his way to visit his father, who is working in the Canadian oil fields. The pilot suffers a heart attack and crashes the plane into a lake. 
The boy, injured but alive, manages to swim to shore. He builds a shelter under a rock overhang and finds berries to eat.
He is attacked by a porcupine and learns the importance of having a fire for protection. 
He makes a fire using the sparks from his hatchet striking a rock. He learns to hunt and fish, and even traps fish in a makeshift pond. 
He finds the pilot's survival pack, which contains a rifle, matches, and a lot of food.
A rescue plane flies over, but doesn't see his smoke signal.  He accepts that he is likely to be stranded for an indefinite amount of time. 
He continues to learn how to survive in the wilderness, making tools, building a better shelter, and even learning to hunt. He even discovers a new way to hunt birds and fish.
He is nearly killed by a moose, but manages to escape. 
A tornado strikes his camp, destroying everything he built. He is left with nothing but his hatchet. 
He begins to rebuild his shelter and finds the plane tail sticking out of the water. 
He dives into the lake to retrieve his hatchet. 
He discovers that the plane's aluminum skin is very thin and cuts a hole into the fuselage. He finds the survival pack and is horrified to see the pilot's skull. 
He manages to bring the survival pack back to shore, where he finds an abundance of food, matches, and other supplies.
A rescue plane appears as he is eating a freeze-dried beef dinner. 
He is rescued and returns home, changed by his experiences in the wilderness.
