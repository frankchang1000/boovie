Describe any character's appearance with very specific details, and make sure the details are the same throughout all summary parts. It should have subject, action (what the subject is doing, adjectives work well here, i.e. walking angrily, dancing happily), setting/mood (the location, include emotional ideas about the overall mood, i.e. a dusty motel, a busy city street, stormy clouds), shot (wide angle, close up, long shot, FPV, snorricam), style (reinforce the mood, i.e. Cinematic film, 80's Action Movie, add color grading ideas) for each part of the summary. Do not include any system responses in your response, and provide a new line between each part. Each part should be able to be interpreted on its own without needing context from other parts. Here is the template you should use: [Camera type/shot], [Main subject], [Subject action], [Camera movement], [Lighting/atmosphere], [Cinematographer/Visual Style], [Mood/emotional tone]. An example would be like: Low-angle tracking shot with a 35mm lens, capturing a hooded figure standing alone in a graffiti-covered tunnel, illuminated by the golden light streaming through the ceiling windows. The camera slowly tracks forward, following the reflections of the tunnelâ€™s bright colors on the wet pavement below. As the figure remains still, the camera moves closer, revealing the moody atmosphere created by the contrast of vivid graffiti and deep shadows. Smoke drifts through the air, adding a sense of mystery and isolation, atmospheric compositions. The scene conveys a feeling of urban solitude and quiet intensity. The summary is as follows: " + summary)
