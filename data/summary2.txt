The young man attends one of his neighbor's extravagant parties and meets a young woman, a professional golfer, who tells him the man's name is Gatsby.  Gatsby is rumored to have been involved in criminal activity, and the young man finds himself drawn to Gatsby's mystique.

The young man is invited to Gatsby's house for lunch and meets Gatsby's friend, a powerful gangster. Gatsby reveals that he is in love with a married woman named Daisy, who lives across the bay. 

Gatsby asks the young man to arrange a meeting between himself and Daisy, and the young man invites Daisy to his house for tea, hoping to bring Gatsby and Daisy back together after five years of separation.
