The story follows Ginger, a giraffe in Kenya, who is able to help her friend, Mickey the monkey, when a drought threatens the savannah. Mickey is starving, and Ginger helps him find food while realizing that other animals, like zebras, antelopes, and elephants, are also suffering. They journey to seek advice from Leo the Lion, who suggests they move to the jungle for more food, as the savannah is suffering from lack of rain.

While en route, they are met with a dangerous fire caused by the dry conditions. Luckily, Ginger's height allows her to see a safe path, leading the animals to safety. Finally, a much-needed rain arrives, putting out the fire and ending the drought, making the dangerous trek to the jungle unnecessary.
