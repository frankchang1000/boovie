A tall giraffe with long, brown spots, gracefully reaches into the branches of a tall tree to find food.  
A small, playful monkey, wearing a bright blue and green outfit, begs the giraffe to help him find some food in a vibrant, sunny savanna. 
The monkey informs the giraffe that the savanna has become dry and barren. 
The giraffe and monkey, both wearing concerned expressions, travel through the expansive grasslands looking for the lion.
The lion, with a stern but compassionate look on his face, advises the animals to relocate to the nearby forest. 
A large crowd of animals, all looking hopeful and anxious, gather at the edge of the savanna, waiting to hear the giraffe's plan.
