A teenager sits in a small plane, the windows revealing vast, blue skies. The pilot, dressed in a worn leather jacket, clutches his stomach, his face contorted in pain.

A commercial airplane plummets towards the ground, the forest rushing closer with every passing second. The cockpit, illuminated by flickering red lights, becomes a chaotic scene of desperation.

A young boy, gripping the controls with trembling hands, struggles to keep the plane level. The radio crackles with static, the boy's voice filled with urgency as he tries to reach for help.

The engine sputters and dies, plunging the plane into an unsettling silence. The forest below appears closer and closer, casting ominous shadows on the plane's windows.

The plane dips low, narrowly missing the surface of the lake before crashing into the trees. The impact sends a wave of shock through the aircraft, tearing it apart with a sickening crunch.

The plane, now submerged in the murky water, slowly sinks below the surface. A young boy, his body battered and bruised, emerges from the wreckage and swims towards the shore.
